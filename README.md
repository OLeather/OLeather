### Hey!
My name is Owen Leather. I am a programming member on First Robotics Team 1351: TKO. My main interest is computer science, but I also enjoy mechanical engineering.

My main programming languages are Kotlin, Java, Python, and C++.

I'm really interested in robot programming. In the past I have worked on computer vision systems and navigation for robotics, autonomous robot operation, and right now I am focusing on learning about control theory. In the future I hope to learn about machine learning and it's application in robotics, such as aiding in navigation and interaction with the environment.
